It's hosted on heroku but the functionality for uploading pictures will not work because i haven't connected it to a service like AWS. If you want to check the full functionality i suggest you start the app as shown below!


## Start
1. npm install in the client folder;
2. npm run start in the client folder. This will run the app on your browser on localhost:4000;
